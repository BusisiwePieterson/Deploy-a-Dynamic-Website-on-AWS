Deploy a Dynamic Website on AWS

Welcome to another real-world project where I hosted a dynamic Ecommerce website on AWS.

This project made me realize how Ecommerce websites/apps such as Amazon, Shopify, and eBay work in the background. What I love most during my journey is I failed several times but because I already have a solid understanding of how these AWS core services work and being a proactive problem solver, I was able to troubleshoot and rebuild everything from the ground up.

This also helped me understand how encryption in transit happens. How to secure the communication between the web browser and the domain name.

Oh yes, I got FRUSTRATED whenever the results didn't turn out as I expected but it felt great when I resolved it.

The core services I used in this project are:

1. 3-tier VPC with public and private subnets
2. Security groups and EC2 instances
3. NAT gateways and RDS
4. ALB and Route 53
5. ASG and Certificate Manager
6. MySQL Workbench, EFS, and more
